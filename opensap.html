              <p><strong>Format: </strong>Semester-long group project</p>
              <p><strong>Role: </strong>Researcher</p>
              <p><strong>Product: </strong>Learning management system owned and moderated by OpenSAP, a subsidiary of SAP. The platform offers technology and design-related courses to learners around the world at no cost.
              <p><strong>The Challenge: </strong>Increase learner engagement, decrease reliance on moderators, and enhance usability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
              <h3>Determining goals and challenges</h3>
              <p>From our initial stakeholder interview, we determined that our client’s goals included the following:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Increase engagement</strong> among learners on the platform;</li>
                  <li><strong>Decrease reliance</strong> on course moderators;</li>
                  <li>Uncover <strong>usability issues</strong> within the system and determine a course of action.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>To better understand moderators' workload and OpenSAP-specific challenges, my team conducted four hour-long <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with online course moderators. From these interviews, we learned that OpenSAP employees moderate courses as a side job in addition to their full-time responsibilities. Moderators struggle to devote as much time as they would like to providing personalized feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Competitive Evaluation</h2>
              <h3>How are others resolving the same problems?</h3>
              <p>My team completed a competitive evaluation, in which we compared OpenSAP’s platform to other popular systems, such as LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Udemy, and design bootcamps.</p>
              <p>Analysis of competitors led us to the following findings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most learning platforms cater to a <strong>defined target audience</strong>, as indicated by clear marketing messages;</li>
                <li>When it is offered, <strong>expert moderation usually comes with a hefty price tag.</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <img src="imgs/comp_analysis.jpg" alt="competitive analysis">
              <p>Based on our analysis of competitors, we provided some <strong>initial recommendations</strong> to OpenSAP:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Consider <strong>narrowing their target audience;</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Strengthen their brand</strong> to be more competitive.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>OpenSAP’s value add is their expert moderation in areas like technology and design. Part of user engagement stems from determining who wants to engage with the product - for professionals who are trying to pick up extra skills on the side, OpenSAP’s expertise in technology is a definite draw.</p>

              <h2>Survey</h2>
              <h3>What are users looking for?</h3>
              <p>Related to our client’s goal of increasing user engagement, my team designed a survey to determine the types of content and level of moderator engagement that learners prefer when taking an online class. Our participant pool included 28 individuals who had participated in an online learning experience within the past two years.</p>
              <p><strong>Survey results:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Video content</strong> is seen as the most beneficial feature within online learning platforms;</li>
                <li>Of the features that involved moderators, the ability to <strong>chat with the course instructor</strong> about questions was seen as the most beneficial to learning;</li>
                <li>Moderation of courses is beneficial to learning outcomes, but <strong>online learners do not expect expert moderation in free courses.</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <img src="imgs/features.png" class="small_on_desktop" alt="graph of perceived beneficial online learning features">
              <p><strong>Mid-point recommendations:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Shift resources</strong> toward developing high-quality video content and allocate moderator resources toward implementing chat with instructor features;</li>
                <li>Implement a <strong>tiered pricing structure</strong> within the OpenSAP platform that provides expert moderator feedback as a premium feature.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <h2>Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Study</h2>
              <h3>Troubleshooting usability issues</h3>
              <p>Using Nielsen’s “10 Heuristics” article as a guideline, we conducted a heuristic evaluation of the platform, examining issues such as help documentation, navigation, and more. The most pressing usability issues we found were related to navigation, and we structured the tasks for our usability test based on this finding.</p>
              <img src="imgs/heuristics.jpg" class="small_on_desktop" alt="heuristic evaluation table">
              <br><br>
              <p>Finally, we conducted usability tests with 5 individuals who met the same criteria as our survey group. We analyzed these usability tests for variables such as time on task and number of mistakes.</p>
              <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Online courses require <strong>unique structures and layouts</strong> to guide students through the course;</li>
                <li><strong>Tutorials</strong> can help students feel supported as they begin a course and could lead to increased engagement.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Final recommendations:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Redesign the layout of the course, especially <strong>navigation;</strong></li>
                <li>Include tools for new students to orient them to the course.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Discussion</h2>
              <p>My main takeaway from this project was that <strong>good UX doesn't happen in a vacuum.</strong> My team originally expected to help OpenSAP reach their goals by providing recommendations for the platform's interface and workflow. Though some of our final recommendations were focused on these things, we discovered through our research that OpenSAP's goals would most likely be reached through rebranding efforts and adjustments to their pricing strategy.</p>
              <p> My team found that we were wearing multiple hats throughout this process to give strategic suggestions in addition to our design-related ones. It was helpful that my team's backgrounds varied from marketing to product management, and the need for this expertise during our research emphasized the importance of interdepartmental collaboration within a business context.</p>
