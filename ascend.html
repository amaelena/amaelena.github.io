              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Houston does not currently have a strong UX presence. PROS wanted to increase UX visibility in the community by hosting a conference geared toward UX newbies. This was the first conference that PROS had ever hosted, and they were looking to make the experience as streamlined as possible for attendees.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Conduct research into the conference attendee experience and learn about the type of content that piques the interest of target audience.</p>
              <p><strong>Duration: </strong>Independent project lasting ~6 weeks during internship.</p>
              <p><strong>Role: </strong>Researcher.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Interviews</h2>
              <h3>What matters to conference attendees?</h3>
              <p>To gain some background information about potential attendees, I conducted <strong>11 semi-structured interviews</strong> with students, early-career professionals, and career-changers. I asked them about previous conferences they had attended, their opinions about things that they would like to see improved, and what topics interested them most. After completing interviews, I looked for common themes across my notes.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Personas</h2>
              <p>Once I had conducted interviews, I had enough information to construct personas to inform my recommendations. I created three personas, one for each target audience segment.</p>
              <div class="gallery">
                <a href="imgs/becca.png">
                  <img src="imgs/becca.png" alt="student persona"/>
                </a>
                <a href="imgs/sai.png">
                  <img src="imgs/sai.png" alt="non-UX persona"/>
                </a>
                <a href="imgs/noah.png">
                  <img src="imgs/noah.png" alt="early career persona"/>
                </a>
              </div>
              <p>The personas emphasized the differences in priorities between the different groups who might attend the UX conference. Students were interested in learning about <strong>cutting-edge industries,</strong> such as autonomous vehicles and voice technology. Career-changers and non-UX professionals wanted a more <strong>broad introduction to the field,</strong> explaining that it's difficult to figure out how to get started in UX solely based on Internet searches. Early-career professionals, on the other hand, were most interested in learning about new techniques in the field and <strong>gaining hands-on experience through workshops.</strong></p>
              <p>In spite of the differences in interests and priorities, all audience segments placed a high value on workshops and participation during conferences. As I moved into creating a journey map, I kept each group's unique needs in mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Journey Map</h2>
              <h3>What matters to conference attendees?</h3>
              <p>Based on the personas that I had created, I started creating a journey map of what people are thinking about when they decide that they would like to attend a conference. I began with a basic outline based on the responses I had received from my interviewees. From there, I drew separate paths for each target audience segment. While the basic journey was the same across interviewees, students were much more likely to think about networking opportunities than early-career professionals. This group was also most likely to be price-sensitive, pointing out that we would need to prominently call out student discount options within our marketing messages.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p>After gathering information about the conference attendee experience, I presented my findings and recommendations to the greater team. Based on my recommendations, the team updated the marketing plan to include a greater Twitter presence, scheduled a happy hour for after the conference to provide more networking opportunities, and increased the amount of hands-on opportunities and discussion for participants. Pictured are a few of the slides from my presentation.</p>
