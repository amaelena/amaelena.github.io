              <p><strong>Format: </strong>36-hour design competition</p>

              <p><strong>Role: </strong>User Experience Designer</p>

              <p><strong>The Challenge: </strong>Over the course of 36 hours, brainstorm, create, and pitch a product to a panel of judges. Our team chose to address <strong>stress and winter blues</strong> with University students and staff as the primary audience for our product. </p>

              <p><strong>Result: </strong>Our team won <strong>first place</strong> out of 50+ teams that came out to compete in the Open Product Design Competition.</p>

              <h2>User Journey</h2>
              <p>When we arrived at the Makeathon competition on Friday evening, we knew that we had only 36 hours to design a product. Right when we arrived, we began brainstorming potential ideas - knowing that we had design and research expertise on our team as well as a health specialist, we hoped to create something that could leverage everyone's skill sets. Staring out into the gray abyss that is January in Michigan, we thought: <i>how might we cheer up the student population during the winter months?</i></p><br>
              <p>After deciding which problem we hoped to address through our product, we came up with the idea of creating a "happy place" on campus. We began to reach out to our network and ask them: What constitutes a happy place for you? Based on these phone calls, we constructed personas to guide our design decisions.</p>
              <div class="gallery">

                </a>
              </div>
              <p>The key criteria that we gleaned from these phone calls included <strong>privacy, escapism,</strong> and <strong>convenience.</strong> Putting these three things together, we began to conceptualize Happy Pod - a quiet place where one can go to collect their thoughts, conveniently located right on campus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
              <h2>Designing the Product</h2>
              <p>Drawing inspiration from the nursing mothers pods placed in airports, my team designed a pod with a similar shape that provides users with an immersive experience.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The pod’s ceiling contains a “happy light,” which is a special type of lamp that mimics natural sunlight. The walls of the pod are covered by large LCD screens that create the feeling of being in nature. The user can control the scenery on the screens via an interface. We also researched ADA specifications to ensure that our design was compliant. Our goal was to create an oasis for people experiencing stress and low mood due to long winters.</p>

                <div class="sketch-text">
                  <p>I was responsible for conceptualizing the architecture of the pod - where would the seating be? How could we make room for a wheelchair while also maximizing the use of such a small space? I drew the sketch pictured here, and my teammate used Autodesk 360 software to create the renderings.</p>

              <h2>Prototype</h2>
              <p>Pictured are outside and inside views of our pod as well as a sample of the interface. For our final prototype, we added a wheelchair ramp. We also looked into material costs and a strategy to keep the pods clean.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The small size of the pod makes it feasible to place on a college campus without needing to build anything new and permanent. Although we designed this product with college students and staff in mind, it could also be placed in a workplace or airport. A customizable interface allows users to create a "happy place" that works best for their needs.</p>

              <h2>Pitching</h2>
              <p>After spending Friday and Saturday working on our design, my team pitched our product to a panel of judges. During our pitch, we addressed competitors in our space and our business model, walked through our user journey, and presented our prototype. We were honored to earn first place in the open product competition for the feasibility and ingenuity of our product, as well as outstanding teamwork.</p>
